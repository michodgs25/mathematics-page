# Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement HTML& CSS programming languages to create a static mathematics tutorials page.

---------

## Languages

  - In this project I used *HTML5*, *CSS* programming languages.


-------

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github linked to the heroku app, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*
  

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools& accounts installed on your system and an account with:

An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod

I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 8000.
